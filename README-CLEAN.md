# Cleaned repo changes
- Removed all PDF/SB discovery code and dependencies.
- `package.json` scripts simplified: only `build:ma` and `build` remain.
- Delete these files:
  - scripts/_pdf_text.js
  - scripts/resolve_sb_urls.mjs
  - scripts/build_ma_benefits.mjs
- Ensure your data build publishes per-plan JSON under one of these paths:
  - years/<YEAR>/by-plan/<CONTRACT>-<PBP>-<SEGMENT>.json
  - years/<YEAR>/plan-details/<CONTRACT>-<PBP>-<SEGMENT>.json
  - years/<YEAR>/plans/<CONTRACT>-<PBP>-<SEGMENT>.json
  - ...or the CMS key variants supported by `relPlanPaths()` in web-demo/index.html
